# Security Manager | CMMC Compliance Specialist

## Professional Summary

Security Manager with 3+ years of hands-on experience BUILDING and OWNING security programs for SMB clients. Built $160K MSP from scratch, implementing security programs for 30+ clients across manufacturing, finance, and legal sectors. Zero ransomware breaches for all fully managed clients. CMMC RP credentialed with CCP exam passed (January 2026). Targeting CISSP Q2 2026 as gating credential for Security Manager roles. Ready to OWN the security program for a DIB contractor, not just consult on it.

## Why I'm Right for DIB Contractors

### Program Ownership, Not Consulting
I don't just advise—I BUILD and OWN security programs:
- **Built from scratch:** Created complete security programs for 30+ SMB clients
- **Rare credential stack:** CCP + AWS SAA + CMMC RP - uncommon combination
- **Zero ransomware track record:** Not a single breach across 100+ managed endpoints
- **Business builder:** Grew MSP to $160K annual revenue with complete P&L ownership
- **Called when others fail:** Became the "last resort" MSP that actually fixed problems

### Perfect Fit for 20-200 Employee DIB Contractors
Small defense contractors need someone who can:
- OWN the entire security program, not just one piece
- Navigate CMMC compliance from assessment through certification
- Implement practical controls that work for lean organizations
- Communicate risk to leadership in business terms
- Build sustainable programs without enterprise-level budgets

## What Makes Me Different

### Crisis Response and Incident Resolution
Called when other providers failed - real-world security crisis management:
- **Copyright Violation Crisis:** Saved client from ISP service termination by stopping neighbor's piracy through unsecured WiFi
- **Active Compromise Response:** Stopped live attack where attacker was controlling computer remotely - found 30 employees sharing 2 passwords on sticky notes
- **Ransomware Recovery:** Fixed multiple ransomware infections for clients who initially refused proper security - zero incidents after implementing full controls
- **Total Network Compromise:** Cleaned accounting firm's completely infected network after previous provider removed their firewall
- **Pattern Recognition:** 100% of new clients came to us already compromised - we became the "last resort" MSP that actually fixed things

### Federal Compliance Experience

## Personal Philosophy

"Security isn't about checking boxes—it's about building programs that actually protect the mission. My track record of zero ransomware breaches comes from understanding that every control, every policy, and every procedure exists to safeguard what matters most. I don't consult on security programs—I own them."
