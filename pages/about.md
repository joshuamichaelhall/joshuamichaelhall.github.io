# IT Security Professional | Clearance-Ready

<div class="content-section with-divider">
  <p>I implement security controls that actually work. For nearly three years, I built and maintained security programs across 30+ clients in manufacturing, finance, and legal sectors. Zero ransomware losses across 100+ managed endpoints — not luck, but defense-in-depth: enterprise firewalls, EDR, MFA, network segmentation, documented policies, and 24/7 SOC coordination. Now bringing that hands-on experience to the defense industrial base. Seeking IT/security roles with Secret clearance sponsorship in Huntsville, AL. Available immediately.</p>

  <p><strong>Security Operations:</strong> Designed and implemented 11+ end-to-end security architectures. Managed IT for 30+ business clients across manufacturing, finance, legal, and professional services. Deployed enterprise firewalls, implemented endpoint protection, established identity and access management controls, and coordinated with third-party SOC for threat monitoring.</p>

  <p><strong>Regulated Environment Experience:</strong> HIPAA environment experience from BMA Inc. and Vanderbilt Hospital. Led 11-person team through 5,000+ system deployment in healthcare setting.</p>
