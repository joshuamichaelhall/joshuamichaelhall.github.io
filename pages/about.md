# About Me

<div class="content-section with-divider">
  <p>Platform engineer with a unique story: Former MSP owner who built TimothyTek to $250K revenue serving 40+ clients before executing a clean exit. Now combining hard-won business acumen with deep technical expertise to create exceptional value in platform engineering and leadership roles.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The TimothyTek Story:</strong> Built a successful MSP from scratch, navigating complex vendor relationships and learning invaluable lessons about integrity, contract negotiation, and maintaining trust under pressure. The business reached $250K annual revenue with 40+ clients before I executed an integrity-first exit that protected all stakeholders. These battle-tested business skills now enhance my technical capabilities.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Current Technical Focus:</strong> Implementing enterprise-grade network security infrastructure with pfSense while maintaining 3+ hours daily Kubernetes practice for CKA (March 2025). Not just studying - building real production patterns that demonstrate platform engineering excellence.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Helping Others Succeed:</strong> Passionate about helping engineers reach $150K+ compensation through strategic skill development and positioning. My unique perspective from building a business provides insights most technical coaches lack. Free consultations available for serious professionals ready to transform their careers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Seeking:</strong> Contract-to-hire platform engineering roles with clear path to leadership. Interested in organizations that value business acumen alongside technical excellence. Geographic flexibility with $150-180K initial target and proven ability to deliver exceptional ROI.</p>
