# About Me

<div class="content-section with-divider">
  <p>I'm a transitioning DevOps Engineer with comprehensive IT infrastructure experience and software engineering foundations. My career combines proven leadership in technical operations with emerging expertise in modern cloud technologies, positioning me uniquely for DevOps roles in regulated industries.</p>
  
  <p>My professional journey includes leading a 13-person technical team through a 5,000-system deployment at Vanderbilt University Hospital, building and scaling an IT services company serving 40+ clients, and completing 95% of Launch School's rigorous backend curriculum. This diverse background provides a solid foundation for understanding both the operational challenges and technical solutions that define effective DevOps practices.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, I'm focused on building specialized expertise in AWS cloud architecture, Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, and security automation specifically for financial services environments. I'm pursuing AWS Solutions Architect Associate and Terraform Associate certifications while developing portfolio projects that demonstrate secure, compliant infrastructure solutions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I'm seeking mid-level DevOps Engineer roles in financial services beginning December 2025, bringing together infrastructure automation expertise with comprehensive AWS, Security+, and Terraform certifications.</strong></p>
