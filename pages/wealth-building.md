## The Philosophy

"Build boring businesses that solve expensive problems for rich companies."

Cloud waste is a $210B problem growing 23% annually. I'm building the expertise and authority to capture my share.

Not through VC-funded growth or employee scaling, but through high-margin expertise that compounds.
