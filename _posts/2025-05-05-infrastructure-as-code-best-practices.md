Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has transformed how organizations deploy and manage cloud resources. For financial services, where security and compliance requirements are especially stringent, implementing proper IaC practices is crucial. This post explores best practices for using Terraform to build secure, compliant AWS infrastructure for financial applications.

## Why Infrastructure as Code Matters for Financial Services

Financial institutions face unique challenges when deploying infrastructure:

1. **Strict Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance with regulations like SOX, PCI-DSS, and GDPR
2. **Enhanced Security Needs**: Protection of sensitive financial and personal data
3. **Audit Trail Requirements**: Detailed documentation of all infrastructure changes
4. **Disaster Recovery Mandates**: Robust resilience and recovery capabilities
5. **Environment Consistency**: Identical configurations across development, testing, and production

Infrastructure as Code addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Consistency**: Identical environments through code-defined infrastructure
- **Auditability**: Complete change history through version control
- **Automation**: Reduced human error through automated deployments
- **Compliance**: Built-in security controls and compliance checks
- **Testing**: Infrastructure validation before deployment

## Terraform Project Structure for Financial Services

A well-organized Terraform project structure is essential for maintainability and compliance. Here's a recommended structure for financial services:

```
financial-infrastructure/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   └── terraform.tfvars
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   └── terraform.tfvars
│   └── prod/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── variables.tf
│       └── terraform.tfvars
├── modules/
│   ├── networking/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   └── outputs.tf
│   ├── security/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   └── outputs.tf
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   ├── variables.tf
│   │   └── outputs.tf
│   └── compliance/
│       ├── main.tf
│       ├── variables.tf
│       └── outputs.tf
├── policies/
│   ├── iam/
│   └── s3/
├── tests/
│   ├── security/
│   └── compliance/
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        ├── terraform-validate.yml
        ├── security-scan.yml
        └── compliance-check.yml
```

This structure separates environments while maintaining consistent module usage and allows for environment-specific configurations.

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Network Security

Network security forms the foundation of a secure financial infrastructure:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "../../modules/networking"
  
  vpc_cidr            = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_flow_logs    = true
  flow_logs_retention = 90
  
  # Create separate subnets for different tiers
  private_subnets     = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
  database_subnets    = ["10.0.3.0/24", "10.0.4.0/24"]
  public_subnets      = ["10.0.5.0/24", "10.0.6.0/24"]
  
  # Create Network ACLs for each subnet tier
  create_network_acls = true
  
  # Enable VPC endpoints for secure AWS service access
  enable_s3_endpoint       = true
  enable_dynamodb_endpoint = true
  enable_ssm_endpoint      = true
}
```

Key recommendations:
- Implement proper subnet segmentation
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for network traffic auditing
- Use network ACLs and security groups in combination
- Implement private endpoints for AWS services

### 2. IAM and Access Management

For financial services, identity and access management must follow strict least-privilege principles:

```hcl
module "iam_roles" {
  source = "../../modules/security/iam"
  
  # Define granular roles with least privilege
  application_roles = {
    "payment-processor" = {
      trusted_entities = ["ec2.amazonaws.com"]
      inline_policies  = file("../../policies/iam/payment-processor.json")
      managed_policies = ["arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess"]
    }
  }
  
  # Define permission boundaries for all roles
  permission_boundary_policy = file("../../policies/iam/boundary.json")
  
  # Enable session tags for enhanced auditing
  enable_session_tags = true
}
```

Key recommendations:
- Implement strict permission boundaries
- Use separate roles for different application components
- Implement just-in-time access for administrative functions
- Enable comprehensive IAM auditing

### 3. Data Protection

Protecting sensitive financial data requires multiple layers of security:

```hcl
module "s3_data_storage" {
  source = "../../modules/security/s3"
  
  bucket_name = "financial-data-${var.environment}"
  
  # Enable encryption with CMK
  enable_encryption = true
  kms_key_id        = aws_kms_key.data_key.arn
  
  # Enable versioning for data recovery
  enable_versioning = true
  
  # Configure access logging
  enable_access_logging = true
  log_retention_days    = 365
  
  # Configure strict bucket policies
  bucket_policy = file("../../policies/s3/financial-data.json")
  
  # Block public access
  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

Key recommendations:
- Encrypt all data at rest and in transit
- Implement strict access controls
- Enable comprehensive data access logging
- Implement data lifecycle policies for compliance

## Compliance Controls

### 1. Automated Compliance Checking

Integrating compliance checks into your CI/CD pipeline ensures infrastructure meets regulatory requirements:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/compliance-check.yml
name: Compliance Check

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'environments/**'
      - 'modules/**'

jobs:
  compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run tfsec
        uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          soft_fail: false
          
      - name: Run checkov
        uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
        with:
          directory: environments/prod
          framework: terraform
          soft_fail: false
          
      - name: Run custom PCI-DSS checks
        run: |
          ./scripts/compliance/pci-dss-check.sh
```

Key recommendations:
- Implement automated compliance scanning in CI/CD
- Create custom checks for financial industry regulations
- Block deployments that fail compliance checks
- Generate compliance reports for auditors

### 2. Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logging is essential for financial services compliance:

```hcl
module "cloudtrail" {
  source = "../../modules/compliance/cloudtrail"
  
  # Enable comprehensive logging
  include_global_service_events = true
  enable_log_file_validation    = true
  
  # Enable multi-region logging
  is_multi_region_trail = true
  
  # Configure log encryption and protection
  kms_key_id                    = aws_kms_key.audit_key.arn
  cloudwatch_logs_retention     = 365
  s3_key_prefix                 = "audit-logs"
  
  # Enable CloudTrail Insights
  enable_insight_events = true
  insight_selector = [
    "ApiCallRateInsight",
    "ApiErrorRateInsight"
  ]
}
```

Key recommendations:
- Enable AWS CloudTrail with log file validation
- Configure comprehensive CloudWatch Logs
- Implement immutable log storage
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities

## State Management Best Practices

Properly managing Terraform state is critical for financial services infrastructure:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "terraform-state-financial-services"
    key            = "environments/prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "alias/terraform-state-key"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
  
  required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
  
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Key recommendations:
- Use encrypted remote state storage
- Implement state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- Restrict access to state files
- Implement state backup procedures
- Version and tag state files for auditing

## Disaster Recovery and High Availability

Financial systems must implement robust disaster recovery capabilities:

```hcl
module "rds_database" {
  source = "../../modules/database/rds"
  
  # Configure multi-AZ deployment
  multi_az = true
  
  # Enable automated backups
  backup_retention_period = 30
  backup_window           = "03:00-05:00"
  
  # Configure enhanced monitoring
  monitoring_interval     = 30
  monitoring_role_arn     = aws_iam_role.rds_monitoring.arn
  
  # Enable deletion protection
  deletion_protection = true
  
  # Configure automated snapshot copies to DR region
  copy_snapshots_to_region = "us-west-2"
  snapshot_copy_kms_key_id = data.aws_kms_key.dr_region_key.arn
}
```

Key recommendations:
- Implement multi-region infrastructure for critical systems
- Configure automated backup and recovery procedures
- Implement regular disaster recovery testing
- Document recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs)

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Automating infrastructure deployment through CI/CD pipelines ensures consistency and reduces risk:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/terraform-deploy.yml
name: Deploy Infrastructure

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - 'environments/prod/**'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
          
      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
      
      - name: Terraform Init
        run: |
          cd environments/prod
          terraform init
      
      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: |
          cd environments/prod
          terraform plan -out=tfplan
      
      - name: Security and Compliance Check
        run: |
          ./scripts/audit/scan-plan.sh environments/prod/tfplan
      
      - name: Manual Approval
        uses: trstringer/manual-approval@v1
        with:
          secret: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          approvers: financial-services-approvers
          minimum-approvals: 2
      
      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: |
          cd environments/prod
          terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
      
      - name: Post-Deploy Validation
        run: |
          ./scripts/validate/infrastructure-test.sh prod
```

Key recommendations:
- Implement infrastructure validation tests
- Require multi-person approval for production changes
- Create detailed deployment documentation
- Implement automated rollback procedures
