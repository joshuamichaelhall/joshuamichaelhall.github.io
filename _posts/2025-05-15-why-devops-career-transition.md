# Why I'm Transitioning to DevOps/SRE: My Career Journey

The decision to transition into DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering wasn't made overnight. It's the culmination of years of technical experiences, careful market research, and a growing fascination with infrastructure automation. This post documents the beginning of my journey and why I believe DevOps—specifically with a financial services focus—is the right direction for my career.

## Building in Public: Documenting My Journey

I've decided to document my DevOps career transition journey in real-time, sharing both successes and challenges along the way. Why build in public?

1. **Accountability**: Public commitment increases follow-through
2. **Community**: Connecting with others on similar paths
3. **Learning acceleration**: Teaching concepts solidifies understanding
4. **Portfolio building**: Creating a living document of my technical growth

As I progress through my roadmap, I'll be sharing detailed technical tutorials, project implementations, and lessons learned. This isn't just content creation—it's a structured approach to my own learning and skill development.

## Why DevOps/SRE?

Several factors influenced my decision to pursue this career path:

### Technical Alignment

My background in software development and systems administration provided a natural bridge to DevOps. I've always found myself gravitating toward:

- **Infrastructure and architecture** over application development
- **Automation** over manual processes
- **Systems thinking** over isolated component work
- **Terminal-based workflows** over GUI reliance

### Market Opportunity

The DevOps/SRE field continues to show strong growth patterns:

- Consistent demand across industries, especially in financial services
- Resilience during economic fluctuations
- Emphasis on security and compliance expertise
- Remote-friendly work environments

### Financial Services Focus

I'm specifically targeting financial services for several reasons:

1. **Regulatory complexity** creates higher barriers to entry and specialized knowledge
2. **Security requirements** demand deeper technical expertise
3. **Infrastructure stability** is business-critical
4. **Compensation tends to be higher** due to specialized requirements

## My Learning Approach

My technical learning strategy centers around four principles:

1. **Project-based learning**: Building real-world implementations
2. **Certifications as milestones**: Using structured preparation for AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes certs
3. **Public documentation**: Writing articles about what I learn
4. **Specialization**: Focusing on financial services compliance and security automation

## Early Roadmap Focus Areas

For the initial phase of my journey, I'm focusing on four core areas:

### 1. AWS Architecture Fundamentals

Building a strong cloud foundation with:
- VPC architecture for multi-environment deployment
- Security best practices for financial services
- IAM implementation with least-privilege principles

### 2. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Developing expertise in:
- Modular infrastructure design
- State management best practices
- CI/CD integration for infrastructure changes
- Compliance implementation through code

### 3. Containerization Strategies

Focusing on:
- Docker containerization with security best practices
- Multi-stage builds for production environments
- Container security scanning automation

### 4. Terminal-Based Workflow Optimization

Leveraging:
- Neovim for infrastructure code development
- tmux for session management
- CLI-based tools for maximum efficiency
