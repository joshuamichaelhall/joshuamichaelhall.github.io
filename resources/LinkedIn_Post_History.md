Looking forward to discussing architectural trade-offs at Re:Invent in 10 weeks.

Excited to share that I'll be attending AWS Re:Invent in 11 weeks! As someone transitioning from MSP ownership to cloud engineering, I'm looking forward to deep-diving into the latest in serverless, automation, and infrastructure as code. What sessions would you recommend for someone focused on Python/Boto3 automation and Terraform?
