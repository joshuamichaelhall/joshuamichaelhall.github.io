## Summary
Cloud Security Professional with 3+ years of hands-on MSP security operations with zero ransomware incidents for fully managed clients over 2+ years.

I founded and operated an MSP serving 30+ clients with 100+ endpoints, maintaining zero ransomware incidents through operational discipline, not luck. I deployed enterprise firewalls, implemented EDR solutions, and stabilized compromised environments others couldn't handle.

That experience translates directly to enterprise security:
• HIPAA compliance → Healthcare security programs
• PCI-DSS → Financial services requirements
• MSP operations → Multi-tenant security architecture
• Incident response → Security operations maturity

Currently pursuing CISSP Associate (~Mar 2026) and AWS Security Specialty (~Apr 2026) to complement existing AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Security+, and CMMC RP certifications.

**SEEKING:** Senior Security Analyst, GRC Analyst, or Compliance Lead roles in Dallas. Currently in Arkansas, relocating for the right opportunity. Open to financial services, healthcare, or enterprise technology sectors.
