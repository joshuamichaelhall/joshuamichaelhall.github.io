#### Technical Solution Post
```
ðŸ”§ Solved an interesting AWS challenge today.

Problem: Multi-region data replication with sub-second latency requirements

Solution: 
- DynamoDB Global Tables for data layer
- Route 53 for intelligent routing
- CloudFront for edge caching
- Lambda@Edge for request manipulation

Result: 200ms average latency globally, 99.99% availability

Architecture diagram: [link]

What's your approach to multi-region architectures?

#### Cost Optimization Post
```
ðŸ’° Cut AWS costs by 40% without touching application code.

Analysis revealed:
â€¢ Over-provisioned RDS instances (right-sized to save $3K/month)
â€¢ Unattached EBS volumes (automated cleanup saving $500/month)  
â€¢ Data transfer costs (implemented VPC endpoints saving $1K/month)

Python script that found these savings: [GitHub link]

The key is systematic analysis, not random cost cutting.
